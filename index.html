            <h3>Student</h3>
            <p>Hello there! I'm Nyabon Adut, a committed student currently studying Software Engineering at the African Leadership University.
                I'm eager to share a bit about myself and my journey.
                At the African Leadership University, we emphaize our missions over majors, therefore, let's focus
                primarily on my missions while still acknowledging our areas of study.
                My mission is to create a sustainable future where agriculture not only feeds the world but also 
                combats climate change. I will achieve this by developing and promoting eco-friendly, climate-resilient farming practices,
                and leveraging innovative technologies to empower farmers. Through these efforts, I aim to build agricultural systems that
                reduce environmental impact, ensure food security, and adapt to the challenges of a changing climate.

            <div class="hiddenContent">
                <p>Outside my academic journey, I prioritize staying active and grounded by
                   going to the gym, enjoying the balance it brings to my busy life. I'm always eager to 
                   learn, grow, and contribute to the global conversation on sustainability and climate change.
                   I also love swimming as a hobby, watching Youtube videoes on engineering,
                   traveling and touring to new places.
                   These engagements enhanced my knowledge and deepened my commitment to socialising
                   with others, exercising, learning new things and also contribute to my field of study.
